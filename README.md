# NodeJS crash course

A small NodeJS app that I have built to help learn the basics of NodeJS. Allowing a index page, about page and a error page to be displayed in a browser. 


### Node dependencies

I used the http module to create a web server and using a combination of path and fs allows me to access files from my file system with reliable resolved paths.


### Dependencies 

#### Nodemon
Nodemon was used in development to allow me to iterate changes to my app
